## Merkle Airdrop

**This is an efficient system for token distribution that allows for eligibility verification via Merkle proofs and authorized, potentially gasless, claims using cryptographic signatures.**

**What is an Aidrop:**

In the blockchain ecosystem, an airdrop refers to the process where a token development team distributes their tokens to a multitude of different wallet addresses. This is a common strategy with several key purposes:


- **Bootstrapping a Project**: Airdrops can help kickstart a new project by getting its tokens into the hands of a wide user base.
- **Rewarding Early Users**: They serve as a way to acknowledge and reward early adopters, community members, or contributors.
- **Increasing Token Distribution**: A wider distribution can lead to a more decentralized and robust token economy.

Airdrops can involve various token types, including ERC20 (fungible tokens), ERC721 (non-fungible tokens, or NFTs), and ERC1155 (multi-token standard). For this project, our focus will be on an ERC20 airdrop.

Typically, these tokens are gifted for free to eligible recipients. The only cost users might incur is the gas fee required to claim their tokens, a problem we aim to address. Eligibility for an airdrop is usually determined by specific criteria, such as being a developer on the protocol, an active community participant, or having interacted with a particular dApp. The core mechanism involves a list of addresses deemed eligible to claim a predetermined amount of tokens.
